**collabretion of Git and GitHub.**

after creating an GitHub account create a new Repository, name the repository // If you already have a account then just create a new repository

after creating new repositry you will see (...or push an existing repository from the command line)

Command : git push -u origin master

Then you can see that your entair local repository has now been pushed to GitHub into the cloud repository.

Step 31 : To push through all the branches to the GitHub
