## Introduction
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web development. It defines the structure and content of a web page. This README serves as a comprehensive guide to HTML development, covering essential concepts, tools, and best practices.

## Purpose of HTML
HTML is used to create the structure and content of a web page. It defines various elements like paragraphs, images, headers, links, and lists, allowing developers to organize and present information effectively.

## How HTML Works
HTML consists of elements or tags that mark up the text, instructing web browsers on how to display the content. For example, `<p>This is a paragraph in HTML.</p>` defines a paragraph. The browser renders these elements accordingly.

## Learning HTML
To learn HTML, you need:

- Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio Extensions:
  - Prettier: Formats code consistently.
  - Live Server: Launches a development web server for real-time testing.

## Fundamentals of Web Development
To master web development, learn:

- Web development languages and tools.
- Key concepts like URLs, HTTP, and DOM.
- Website functioning.
- Inspecting network traffic.
- Basics of HTML and CSS.
- Validating web pages.

## How the Web Works
The web operates on a client-server model, where the browser (client) requests resources from web servers using protocols like HTTP. The server responds with HTML documents, which browsers render into a Document Object Model (DOM).

## DOM (Document Object Model)
The DOM is a programming interface for web documents, representing the page structure, style, and content. It enables dynamic interactions with web pages through scripting languages like JavaScript.

## Validator W3 (W3C Validation Service)
Validator W3 checks the markup validity of web documents, ensuring compliance with W3C standards, improving accessibility, and promoting best practices in web development.

## Basic HTML Boilerplate
Create a basic HTML template by typing `!` and pressing Tab in Visual Studio Code.

## Meta Tags
Meta tags provide metadata about a web page, including description, author, and viewport settings, improving search engine visibility and user experience.

## HTML Entities
HTML entities represent characters that have specific meanings or are not easily typed. They ensure proper display and compatibility across browsers and devices.

## Tag and Href Attribute
The `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute defines hyperlinks in HTML, enabling navigation to different resources like web pages, files, or email addresses.

## Difference Between Link and Hyperlink
A hyperlink, created with the `<a>` tag, allows users to navigate between resources. A link, typically associated with the `<link>` element, establishes relationships between the current document and external resources like stylesheets.
